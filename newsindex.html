    <p>British police said Sunday they arrested a 12-year-old boy after an English Premier League player shared images of racist messages he had received via social media.
        “Woke up to this today,” Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha wrote Sunday on Twitter, in a post that showed racial imagery, including a photo of a Ku Klux Klan rally. His post also showed taunts such as, “You better not score tomorrow you black [expletive].”
        Zaha, a 27-year-old forward who was born in Ivory Coast before moving to England when he was a child, shared an Instagram account in his post that suggested his abuser was a fan of Aston Villa, Crystal Palace’s opponent Sunday.
        Before the match, Aston Villa said in a statement: “We deplore the disgusting racist messages sent to [Zaha]. We condemn all forms of racial discrimination and stand with [Crystal Palace].

        <p>SHEFFIELD, England -- As Chelsea continue their attempts to add Bayer Leverkusen winger Kai Havertz to their increasing array of attacking talent at Stamford Bridge, Saturday's 3-0 defeat against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane led to the inescapable sense that they're decorating the outside of the house while water continues to pour through the roof.

            With Ajax winger Hakim Ziyech and RB Leipzig forward Timo Werner already added to a squad boasting the likes of Christian Pulisic, Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud up front, the capture of Havertz, if Chelsea can pull it off, would give manager Frank Lampard incredible options going forward next season. But the manner of the loss in Sheffield should set alarm bells ringing within Chelsea's scouting department because the real priority for strengthening at the end of this season should be their defence.

            <p>The Premier League looks set to continue its five substitutions per match rule into next season, with football’s lawmakers reported to be considering keeping the recent update a little longer.

                The International Football Association Board (IFAB) implemented the alteration in May as leagues around Europe returned to action following the three-month break due to the coronavirus pandemic.
                
                But now it seems that it could be set to stay, for at least the whole of next season, if not beyond. It is thought, though, that the water breaks which have been brought in halfway through each half will not continue.

                <p>Mikel Arteta was left to rue Arsenal's 2-1 defeat to Tottenham, claiming "the game was ours", while Jose Mourinho has his sights set on the Europa League.Arsenal were unbeaten in five games heading into Sunday's north London derby and dominated possession - seeing 62.9 per cent of the ball - and taking the lead with a thunderous Alexandre Lacazette strike in the 16th minute.

                <p>Marcelo Bielsa felt Leeds had taken a “step forward” to winning promotion after Pablo Hernández’s late winner secured a 1-0 victory at Swansea.

                    On a day when Leeds paid tribute to club great Jack Charlton, who died at the age of 85 on Friday, Bielsa’s side moved to within four points of ending their 16-year wait to play in the top flight of English football.
                    
                    The Championship leaders are now three points ahead of second-placed West Brom, and six clear of in-form Brentford, with games against Barnsley, Derby and Charlton to come.
